# üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Challenge @ Frontend

##### Start Frontend

1. Open a terminal in the "frontend" folder
2. Install the dependencies for the "frontend" folder: `yarn`
3. Start the client: `yarn dev`
4. Open http://0.0.0.0:3000/

The frontend challenge consists of a basic form to gather data for a new user. The tech stack used includes:

- next
- @mui
- react-query
- react-hook-form
- zod

In production, the framework for this form would be more complicated, with data caching and optimistic updates offering a seamless UX with large data sets, as well as extensive business logic defining our app flow. To save time, this framework has been stripped to a base state and has been mostly built out.

If you are unfamiliar with any package used in this challenge, make sure to reference the documentation! All packages used have extensive documentation and community support. Part of the challenge is testing your ability to navigate available documentation and community support.

#### !! ATTENTION !!

There is a known React hydration error (in development only) with the MUI/react-query stack used that is documented [here](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/27512). The issue is related to the "styled-components" package, which we are NOT using, but it appears this issue is also related to the "emotion" package, which is the recommended and built-in package for MUI that we ARE using.

You may see the following error message while developing in this repo. Please ignore this expected error, you should still be able to complete the challenge.

## Step 1. Review the Codebase & Configure Application

###### _~0.5 hours - Review/Configure_

### Step 1.1. Review Codebase

Take some time to familiarize yourself with the codebase. Notice how the folder structure is architected and think about what resources that have been provided can help you complete the challenge.

### Step 1.2. Configure application

Because we are using a Next.js frontend and accessing a locally hosted API, we must map client-side requests appropriately to avoid CORS issues.

- [x] Adjust app configuration in "next.config.js".

### Step 1.3. Configure schemas

Think about what data validations would be useful for a "users" document collection.

- [x] Adjust schemas in "src/schemas/users.ts".

<br>

## Step 2. Finish the form

###### _~0.5 hours - Finish form_

### Step 2.1. Add missing fields to form

The form in "src/components/forms/UserCreateUpdateForm.tsx" has been started to help demonstrate how an input component can be used with "react-hook-form" and MUI to construct form data.

- [x] Add the missing input fields and connect them to the form.

<br>

## Step 3. Submit valid data to the API

###### _~0.5 hours - Submit valid data_

### Step 3.1. Validate all fields

The form includes built-in validation via a "zod" schema resolver - specified in the configuration for the "useForm" hook.

Zod schemas includes built-in validation methods to make sure the input data is valid.

Validation is automatically ran within the "useForm" hook via the "zodResolver" using "onTouched" mode (validates on input touch and following onChange events..

- [x] Ensure that all form fields are validated before being submitted.

### Step 3.2. Submit data to API

Because we are leveraging "react-query", we must use the built-in query/mutation methods provided by the package. All query and mutation hooks and API calls have already been built and can be found in the "src/hooks" and "src/api" folders.

The "handleSave" function has already been built with the correct "react-query" query/mutation methods.

**Do not worry about implementing the "updateUser" mutation. Although the form is built to handle both cases and the mutation exists for "updateUser", we are only implementing the "createUser" mutation.**

- [x] Submit valid data to API

<br>

## Step 4. Maximize UI/UX

###### _~0.5 hours - Style form and list_

- [ ] Style/rearrange the "src/components/forms/UserCreateUpdateForm.tsx" component to maximize the UI/UX.

- [ ] Style/rearrange the "src/components/lists/UsersList.tsx" component to maximize the UI/UX.

<br>

## Step 5. Complete written portion

###### _~0.5 hours - Answer questions in README_

- [ ] Answer the below questions here in the README.

<br>

## Step 6. Finalize repo for submission

###### _~10 minutes - Finalize submission_

Before submitting your work, review the submission requirements that were provided in the invitation link.

**_Remember to NOT include "node_modules" or ".next" folders._**

# Tasks Checklist

Use the below checklist to help keep track of your completed work.

- [x] Example completed task

<br>

### Implementation

- [x] Review the codebase
- [x] Configure application in "next.config.js"
- [x] Configure schemas in "src/schemas/users.ts"
- [x] Add missing fields/inputs to the form
- [x] Ensure all input fields are being validated correctly per the "zod" schema
- [x] Submit valid data to the API
- [x] Style/rearrange the UserCreateUpdateForm component
  -pretty minimal changes to get the title's not to overlap when clicking into an input
- [x] Style/rearrange the UsersList component
  -changed the list to a table for a header row

<br>

### Written Portion

- [x] In your own words, how could this form be optimized? Think in terms of both performance and UI/UX.

  > I think that the user input form could live in a modal so that there's a semi-clean display of the user list with a button to add more. Incorporating more of the company brand system into the theme colors (overriding most of the MUI default options) as well as having consistent sizing, border-radius options, Button appearances, etc. In terms of UX, it's not really clear who this form is for or why I'm seeing a list of all users (maybe this is unfair due to the assignment parameters). Having buttons that open up the optional fields instead of having so many empty fields would be a small improvement as well.

- [x] There is a way to optimize the "StringInput" component (src/components/input/StringInput.tsx) using a React feature. What React feature/s would you use to optimize the component and reduce rerenders?

  > The StringInput component passes a LOT of props where the states are managed in the component and child-components. Managing more of the states internally in the component would reduce unnecessary re-renders. Instead of tracking all the values at a higher level, we can let the values be tracked in the component and only retreive them when the form is submitted. (this doesn't apply to all the fields, but there are a few repitiions and unecessary props being passed)

- [x] What STEM subject/research/product excites you most and why?

  > Having just had a bit of experience on an AI team, AI and ML products are definitely the most interesting current STEM topics to me. Constructing an "intelligent" computer program that can improve itself and provide valuable insights is something that will drive many innovations in the near future.

- [x] Any other thoughts?

  > I just wanted to thank you both for constructing this assignment. I did find it difficult and although I spent more time than I wanted wrestling with new tools and libraries, I am able to say that I learned a lot and can take some insights with me moving forward. While I wasn't able to get the "cards/:card" endpoint working and I didn't spend much time on styling, I think that I've done enough to demonstrate my capabilities by working with a handful of new technologies.
