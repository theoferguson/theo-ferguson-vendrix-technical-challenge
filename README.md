# Challenge Summary

Your challenge is split into two phases:

- In the **[first phase](#first-phase)**, your objective is to build a basic form to capture new user data.
- In the **[second phase](#second-phase)**, your objective is complete an endpoint which returns data queried from a GraphQL API.

## First Phase

###### _~2 hours - The frontend_

### Introduction

One of the basic functions of a client-side application is user input. A good form for a frontend application should be performant, intuitive, and accurate. Ensuring accuracy with our defined schemas requires data validation during data capture.

### Objective

The goal of this first phase is to implement a form as described in the [frontend README](./frontend/README.md)

Try your best to implement everything within the time frame. If you do find yourself running short on time, you may:

- drop behaviors of your choosing. Please **document the behaviors you drop and why**.
- only one browser support (of your choice)
- no touch screen support
- no dark mode support
- no right-to-left support

## Second phase

###### _~1-2 hours - The backend_

### Introduction

In our Vendrix app, we handle a lot of data and events. In this stripped backend API, there is only one entrypoint implemented ('/'). This endpoint is already complete with no additional work required and serves as the data provider to the frontend as outlined below.

#### Currently Implemented

##### Endpoint: '/'

###### Queries

- getAllUsers

###### Mutations

- createUser

#### Unimplemented (TODO)

##### Endpoint: '/cards/:cardId'

### Objectives

The goal of the second phase is to implement the missing endpoint as described in the [backend README](./backend/README.md)
